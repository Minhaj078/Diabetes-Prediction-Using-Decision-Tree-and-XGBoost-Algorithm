# 🩹 Diabetes Prediction using Classification and Boosting Algorithms

A machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes onset using clinical and demographic data, leveraging classification and boosting algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a full pipeline: ingesting patient data (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age, family history), exploratory analysis to identify patterns, feature engineering to transform and encode relevant variables, training classification and boosting models, and evaluating their predictive performance. The objective is to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes and provide actionable health insights.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Collection

Dataset includes patient attributes such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, insulin level, family history, and target variable indicating presence/absence of diabetes.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution of positive vs negative diabetes cases
* Visualisation of feature distributions such as glucose, BMI, age across classes
* Correlation matrix and relationships between variables
* Identification of missing values, outliers, and data quality issues

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Handling missing values (e.g., imputation of zero glucose entries, insulin levels)
* Encoding categorical features (e.g., family history, gender)
* Creating derived features such as age * BMI interaction, glucose/BMI ratio
* Scaling numerical features
* Splitting into training and test sets using stratification

### 4. Modeling

Algorithms used include:

* **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
* **Random Forest Classifier** (strong performer)
* **Boosting Approaches** such as **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** for improved accuracy

### 5. Evaluation

Metrics used to assess model performance:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC
* Feature importance/SHAP values

**Result:** The boosting model achieved the highest accuracy and generalisation, demonstrating that engineered features and advanced algorithms improved predictive power.

### 6. Prediction & Insights

* Derived predictions for unseen patients
* Analysed feature importance: e.g., glucose level, BMI and age ranked highest
* Provided insights for health monitoring and risk assessment of diabetes
* Recommended preventive actions and ongoing monitoring for high-risk individuals

## 📈 Key Findings

* Elevated glucose and BMI were the most significant predictors of diabetes onset
* Interaction features (age × BMI) improved model performance
* Boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM) outperformed traditional classifiers
* The developed pipeline can assist healthcare professionals in early risk detection

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Expand dataset with larger, more diverse populations and longitudinal tracking
* Incorporate deep learning or sequential models (e.g., recurrent networks for longitudinal data)
* Deploy predictive engine as a web app (Flask/Streamlit) for healthcare providers
* Integrate SHAP or LIME for model explainability in clinical settings
* Monitor model fairness and performance across different demographic groups
